# VBA-challenge


# Hello! Thank you for checking out my VBA - Challenge Assignment! Here are a few notes:

# This code is deigned to be run twice. The first run will produce and calculate all values, the second will produce the conditional formatting. This code will apply to each sheet in the workbook. 

# Repo Files:

# 1. A Macro-Enabled Workbook: This is a copy of our home-work file with added code that has not yet been run. This way you can run the code and see the result first-hand. 

# 2. A .Bas file that is an export of the script from the VBA window, can be uploaded to fresh excel file to have the script added that way as well. 

# 3. A folder of screenshots from the originally run script demonstrating results prior to refreshing the document (thank you Dwight for the refresh sub!).

# Thank you and have a good day!
